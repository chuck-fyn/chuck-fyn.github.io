Hi, I’m Charlie. I first started developing iOS apps in 2014 using Objective-C, and released my first app to the App Store in 2015. In 2021 I decided to re-devote myself to self-study to gain a more thorough understanding of Swift and general mobile design patterns. Since then I have developed, released, and maintained numerous iOS apps both by myself and with a team for various companies, using both UIKit and SwiftUI. The personal project I’m most proud of, Centre Court, introduces a completely new and unique use case for AirPods by using them as remote controls for scoring a tennis Match. Both players can connect their own pair to the same phone, so both players get to help score the match and hear the score announced by the Centre Court umpire. It’s a fun and exciting app, and it helped me learn so much about creating interactive user interfaces, handling and passing CoreData objects, and utilizing clean and efficient code architecture. Please see my public GitHub for access to my personal projects’ source code.
