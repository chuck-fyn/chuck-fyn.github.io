I first started developing iOS apps in 2014, and I released my first app to the Apple App Store in 2015. That same year I decided to pursue other career paths, so it wasn’t until about two years ago that I really devoted myself to self-study to gain a more thorough understanding of Swift and general mobile design patterns. Since then I have developed numerous more iOS apps, and have released two more to the Apple App Store. The app I’m most proud of, Centre Court, introduces a completely new and unique use case for AirPods by using them as remote controls for scoring a tennis Match. And both players connect their own pair to the same phone, so both players get to help score the match and hear the score announced by the Centre Court umpire. It’s a really fun and exciting app, and it helped me learn so much about creating interactive user interfaces, handling and passing CoreData objects, and utilizing clean and efficient code architecture.
